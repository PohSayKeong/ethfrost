# Ethfrost
Bringing interoperability to the next level by massively improving user experience for parachain staking.

By utilizing General Message Passing (GMP), we have interoperability between EVM chains. In our case, we want to first bridge our funds to Moonbeam,

By utilizing Cross-Consensus Message (XCM), we can send messages from Moonbeam to other Polkadot parachains. In our case, we want to send a message to the Bifrost parachain to process the staking of funds.

Combining both techniques, the end result is achieving staking on Bifrost by signing a single transaction on any EVM chain with any native or ERC20 token.
